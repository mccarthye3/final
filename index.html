<p>Welcome to the home page of my portfolio. 
   I am currently a senior at Emmanuel College. I am an interdepartmental individualized major with a concentration in Graphic Design and Bio-Physiology. The goal of my academic career and post academic pursuits is to demonstrate how art can, and should be, utilized in education. The fields of STEM and Design have a strained relaitonship, however, both can coexist peacefully and learn from each other to create a well rounded education for all individuals pursing any degree.
   I initially began my academic career as a biology major with a concentration in health sciences. I was fascinated by anatomy and physiology. However, as I continued my education, I realized I truly enjoyed drawing and visualizing the working pieces of the human body. With this in mind, I decided to change my major and double in graphic design as well as biology, in order to pursue both interests. As this continued, I noticed how separate the art and STEM communities were, and I wanted to change that. My experience in college primarily fueled my love for education, and using art as universal teaching language. Through this site, you will see my work, as well as my passion.
